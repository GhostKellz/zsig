Here's a prompt you can use to fix the build issues:

**Fix ZWallet Build System and Dependency Integration**

The ZWallet project has corrupted/duplicated content in build.zig and dependency conflicts. Please:

1. **Clean up build.zig**:
   - Remove the duplicated/corrupted module definition (lines 19-31 have duplicate imports)
   - Fix the module structure to properly use zcrypto, realid, zsig, and tokioz dependencies
   - Ensure the executable, tests, and FFI library builds work correctly

2. **Fix dependency integration**:
   - Update root.zig to properly import and re-export the new dependencies
   - Fix any API compatibility issues with RealID v0.2.0 and ZCrypto v0.3.0
   - Update the wallet, transaction, and other modules to use the new dependency APIs

3. **Resolve build errors**:
   - Fix any import path issues
   - Update function signatures that may have changed in the new dependency versions
   - Ensure all modules compile without errors

4. **Test the build**:
   - Run `zig build` to ensure basic compilation works
   - Run `zig build test` to verify tests pass
   - Run `zig build example` and `zig build realid-cli` to test examples

The current build.zig.zon has the correct dependencies:
- zcrypto v0.3.0
- realid v0.2.0  
- zsig (latest)
- tokioz (latest)

Focus on making the build system work cleanly with these four dependencies and fixing any API compatibility issues from the version updates.

This prompt covers all the main issues that need to be addressed to get ZWallet building properly with the updated dependencies.
